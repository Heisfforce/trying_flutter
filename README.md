# Reflection
Last tuesday, we tackled about what is Git, Github, and Flutter are through the video presentation of Sir Edward Bertulfo. I've already used Github before during my freshman year when Sir Jaime Condes told us to create a web profile on Github as our final project for his subject, so i already had a little knowledge about it. The topic you discussed last tuesday sir helped me gain more knowledge about Github, especially things I didn't know before, such as how it works together with Git and how to use it properly. I've also used Github Desktop before, I encounted it while searching online for steps on how to create my web profile. Also, I used Github Desktop to push and commit changes. What's new for me is Flutter and I learn new things about it last tuesday, and I want to learn more about how it works and how to use it so that I can apply it properly in the future discussion.
